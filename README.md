# Giter8 template for building Microservice using Scala, Play and Reactive Mongo
    
This will create a Play project using

* Scala 2.11.1 as language
* Sbt 0.13.5 as build tool
* Play 2.3.2 as framework
* Macwire 0.7 for dependency injection
* Reactive Mongo DB 0.11.0-SNAPSHOT as database

### From Git repo directly    
    
    g8 git@github.com:sameergarg/scala-play-macwire-reactivemongo.g8.git --name [name of the project]

### From local file
This is useful when you are making changes to template locally

    g8 file://[path to the git project]/scala-play-macwire-reactivemongo.g8 --name=[name of the project]
